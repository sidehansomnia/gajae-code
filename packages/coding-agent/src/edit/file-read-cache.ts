/**
 * Per-session cache of file contents as they were rendered to the model by
 * the `read` and `search` tools in the current agent session.
 *
 * Used by hashline-mode anchor-stale recovery: if the model authored anchors
 * against a version of the file that no longer matches what is on disk —
 * because a subagent, the user, a linter, or a formatter modified the file
 * between the read and the edit — we replay the edits against the cached
 * pre-edit snapshot and 3-way-merge the result onto the live file.
 *
 * Scoped per `ToolSession`: the cache lives on the session object itself, so
 * different sessions never share snapshots and entries get reclaimed when
 * the session goes out of scope. Each session keeps a small LRU window of
 * paths; the newest generation always reflects what *this* session most
 * recently saw, so it stays correct by construction even when this session
 * writes the file itself — the next read after the write refreshes the entry.
 *
 * When newly observed lines disagree with the newest generation (the file
 * changed, e.g. because this session just edited it), the previous generation
 * is retained behind the new one instead of being discarded. A model commonly
 * issues a follow-up edit with anchors from its original read after its own
 * edit shifted lines; recovery replays those anchors against the older
 * generation they were authored for.
