 *    incarnation string comparison alone.
 * 2. `prepare_restart` against that exact owner tuple/generation; on any
 *    prepare refusal, cancel the reservation and return the broker's own
 *    typed refusal rather than throwing.
 * 3. `commit_restart` with the exact lease/occupancyEpoch prepare returned.
 *    Once committed, the owner is durably retiring: cancellation is no longer
 *    safe and this function must never call cancel past this point.
 * 4. Close the client (every path below runs with the client closed).
 * 5. Wait, bounded by the request deadline, for `observeProcessIncarnation`
 *    to positively confirm the exact old pid is OS-absent -- never inferred
 *    from a changed/missing incarnation read, and never from discovery
 *    disappearing (a crashed writer can leave a stale discovery file behind
 *    just as easily as a clean exit can remove it).
 * 6. Launch (or adopt an already-published) exactly one successor for this
 *    requestId, holding the shared startup exclusion only around the launch
 *    decision itself -- never across the successor's own publication wait,
 *    which would deadlock this process against its own spawned child.
 *
 * The successor clears the durable committed intent itself, from inside its
 * own `Broker#start()`, only after its own publication has independently
 * proven it owns the root -- never here, and never before that proof exists.
