/**
 * Public prompt-result DTO contract for canonical Q26 `turn.result` with
 * `kind: "prompt"`, plus the legacy `turn.prompt_status` alias and the `clientRef`
 * correlation field on `turn.prompt`.
 *
 * Semantics:
 * - `turn.prompt` remains ordered and non-idempotent. An envelope
 *   `idempotencyKey` is ignored for replay/conflict purposes on ordered
 *   operations (no replay cache, no `idempotency_conflict`).
 * - `clientRef` is a caller-chosen correlation key (trimmed, non-empty,
 *   1..PROMPT_CLIENT_REF_MAX_LENGTH chars; one fresh value per logical prompt)
 *   mapped to the generated commandId/turnId at preflight acceptance so a
 *   caller can reconcile after a lost acknowledgement frame.
 * - The clientRef index is scoped to one live session runtime: identical refs
 *   may coexist in different sessions, lookups never cross sessions, a ref
 *   conflicts only while its record is retained (`client_ref_conflict`), and
 *   after terminal capacity eviction a ref may be admitted again with the
 *   prior outcome unknown — callers MUST NOT reuse a clientRef as a retry
 *   mechanism and MUST treat `unknown` as uncertainty, not proof of
 *   non-execution.
 * - Prompt records survive process restart: an active prompt is finalized from its
 *   durable pending outcome, or as `prompt_failed` when it has none. Only skill
 *   records settle as `process_restart`, and a lookup reports `unknown` only after
 *   retained-record capacity eviction.
 * - Q26 tracks prompts accepted through the SDK control surface (which always
 *   carries a requesting connection); submissions without a delivery owner are
 *   outside the reconciliation contract and hold no reservation.
 * - A terminal outcome settles once: the first terminal transition wins. A late
 *   `agent_failed` (arriving on a different delivery path than the one that
 *   claimed the terminal) may still attach its bounded, sanitized reason to an
 *   already-terminal record that has none, surfaced as `error` on `terminal_ok`.
 *   It never changes status, `terminalAt`, retention order, or the clientRef
 *   index, and the first recorded reason always wins over a later frame.
