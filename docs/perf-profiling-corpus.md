# Perf profiling corpus

The profiling corpus is the **successor** to the static [`cpu-hotspot-map.json`](./cpu-hotspot-map.json) ranking (see [`hotspot-map-successor.md`](./hotspot-map-successor.md)). The static map ranked hotspots by complexity × trigger frequency but never measured real CPU self-time. The corpus replaces that guess with measured, separated evidence and is the source of future perf prioritization.

Implementation:

- Schema + evidence taxonomy + validation: `packages/coding-agent/bench/perf-corpus-schema.ts`
- Runner: `packages/coding-agent/bench/perf-corpus.bench.ts`
- Threshold/evidence ledger: `packages/coding-agent/bench/perf-threshold.ledger.ts`
- Tests: `packages/coding-agent/test/perf-corpus.test.ts`
- Deterministic memory surface workloads: `packages/coding-agent/bench/memory-baseline-workloads.ts`
- Session replay profiling harness: [`packages/coding-agent/bench/session-replay/replay.bench.ts`](../packages/coding-agent/bench/session-replay/replay.bench.ts), with report aggregation, replay fidelity, provenance, and stability comparison in [`profile-report.ts`](../packages/coding-agent/bench/session-replay/profile-report.ts). Run it with `bun run bench:profile -- --scenario all`; output is isolated under `.gjc/profiles/<git-sha>/`.

## Evidence taxonomy

Each metric and optimization claim is classified by **evidence class**. These classes must never be conflated:

| Class | Meaning | Sufficient for CPU self-time? |
|---|---|---|
| `wall-clock-proxy` | elapsed time around a phase/operation | No |
| `process-cpu-usage` | `process.cpuUsage()` user/system deltas | No |
| `profiler-self-time` | profiler/sampled attribution of self-time to a symbol | **Yes (required)** |
| `rss-memory` | RSS/heap baseline/growth/return | No (memory only) |
| `byte-parity` | golden rendered/persisted/provider/materialized comparisons | n/a (safety) |
| `ledger-approved-threshold` | human-approved threshold change | n/a (process) |

Optimization **status vocabulary** for a hotspot:

- `CPU-self-time confirmed` — requires `profiler-self-time` evidence (an `artifactPath` or non-empty `samples`).
- `fallback-toggle-confirmed` — comparable before/after or feature/fallback-toggle evidence proves an end-to-end win without byte changes.
- `covered-current` — the corpus exercises the path but has no comparable before/after evidence.
- `not-visible` — the path was not exercised or showed no measurable impact.
- `needs-trace-coverage` — the corpus lacks fixture coverage for the path.

A v1–v3 win is **never** called "confirmed" from current-only coverage. `validatePerfCorpusReport()` enforces this: a `CPU-self-time confirmed` classification is rejected unless the report carries profiler self-time evidence.

## Schema (gjc.perf-corpus/2)

`PerfCorpusReport` keeps the evidence classes as **separate named fields** per fixture:

- `wallClockPhase: Record<string, { elapsedMs, p50Ms?, p95Ms?, advisoryOnly }>`
- `processCpuUsage: Record<string, { userMicros, systemMicros, elapsedMs, cpuFraction? }>`
- `profilerSelfTime: { profiler, artifactPath?, samples? }`
- `rssMemory: { baselineBytes, peakBytes?, growthBytes, returnBytes, ... }`
- `byteParity: { renderedGolden?, persistedJsonlGolden?, providerPayloadGolden?, materializedSessionGolden? }`
- `memoryBaseline?: { surface, profile, iterations, operations, operationsPerSecond, samples, postTeardown, rssSlopeBytesPerSecond, heapSlopeBytesPerSecond, processTreeBaselineRssBytes, processTreePostTeardownRssBytes, processTreeSampler }`
- `runner: { command, argv, environment, platform, arch, bunVersion?, ci?, profile, durationTargetMs?, memoryIsolation, iterationsTarget, gcExposed, memoryChildGcExposed, memoryChildExecArgv }` pins the actual parent argv, normalized workload controls, isolation, parent GC availability, and the fixed isolated-child runtime flags separately.
- `gitSha` is the full checked-out `HEAD` when Git is available, with `GITHUB_SHA` used only as a fallback; `gitDirty` explicitly marks tracked or untracked worktree changes so local evidence cannot silently masquerade as a clean commit. The runner captures SHA and the complete porcelain worktree fingerprint before and after the workloads and rejects any in-flight source-state change.
- Every detailed sample separates `rssBytes`, `heapUsedBytes`, `heapTotalBytes`, `externalBytes`, `arrayBuffersBytes`, and `activeResourceCount`.

`hotspotClassifications: HotspotClassification[]` carry `{ hotspotId, status, evidenceClass, artifactRefs, notes }`. The current v1–v3 reclassification lives in `V1_V3_RECLASSIFICATION`; no entry there is `CPU-self-time confirmed` because the base runner attaches no profiler. Profiler-backed reclassifications for the agent-session hotspots come from `bench/agent-session-profile.ts` (see [Agent-session profiler evidence](#agent-session-profiler-evidence-5942)).

## Privacy rules

- Never commit raw private session transcripts.
- Default fixtures are `synthetic` (deterministic PRNG, no real data).
- `sanitized-real` / `dogfood-redacted` fixtures are allowed only with documented redaction in `privacy.redactionNotes`; `privacy.rawPrivateTranscriptCommitted` must be `false`.

## Commands

```bash
# Emit a corpus report (stable JSON)

```

## Profiler-artifact expectations

The base runner attaches no profiler (`profilerSelfTime.profiler: "none"`), so it can never promote a hotspot to `CPU-self-time confirmed`. To confirm CPU self-time:

1. Capture a profiler artifact (e.g. a `.cpuprofile`) while running the relevant fixture.
2. Record it in the fixture's `profilerSelfTime` as `{ profiler, artifactPath, samples }`.
3. Set the hotspot classification to `CPU-self-time confirmed` with `evidenceClass: "profiler-self-time"` and the artifact in `artifactRefs`.
4. `validatePerfCorpusReport()` will then accept the claim.

`bench/agent-session-profile.ts` automates this for the `memory-agent-session-lifecycle` fixture. Its report's `profilerSelfTime` drops into that fixture and its `hotspotClassifications` validate against it.

## Agent-session profiler evidence (#5942)

The `short`/`soak` corpus reported an agent-session RSS slope of 28.8 MB/s and a heap slope of 14.8 MB/s (153 → 244 MB), but had no profiler evidence. `bench/agent-session-profile.ts` runs the same `createSessionWorkload()` in two equal phases:

1. **Memory phase, unprofiled.** A forced full GC runs every `--sample-interval-ms` (default 1000). Each sample records pre-GC RSS and heap, then post-GC RSS, `heapUsed`, external bytes, and the live JSC object count. V8 heap snapshots are taken after warm-up (at 1/4 of the run) and at the end. The CPU profiler stays detached because its sample buffer lives on the JS heap.
2. **CPU phase.** The inspector CPU profiler samples every 500 µs and writes a `.cpuprofile`.

Retention is judged from the **snapshot-reachable self size** and the live object count across the steady-state window. It is never judged from RSS, which keeps allocator pages already released, or from `heapUsed` alone. JSC `heapUsed` can step up by a heap block without any new reachable objects.

```bash
bun --smol packages/coding-agent/bench/agent-session-profile.ts [--duration-ms 30000] [--sample-interval-ms 1000] [--out artifacts/perf/agent-session-profile]
```

The output directory holds `agent-session-lifecycle.cpuprofile`, `agent-session-lifecycle.{early,late}.heapsnapshot`, and `agent-session-profile.json`. That directory is `artifacts/` by default, which is gitignored; artifacts are regenerated, not committed.

### Recorded result

- Measurement: commit `f0b74b4dcd80`, clean worktree, Bun 1.4.0, linux-x64, `--duration-ms 30000 --sample-interval-ms 1000`, three independent runs. Each run did 2.04–2.26 M appends and profiled about 30 s of CPU.
- **Verdict for this fixture: `bounded-high-water` in 3/3 runs.** Across the fixture's 128-entry sessions there is no retention, and the corpus RSS slope is allocator high-water:
  - Snapshot-reachable heap moved from 24.27–24.36 to 23.83–24.87 MiB (−0.53 to +0.56 MiB) across the steady-state window.
  - The live object count *fell* by 420–582 objects.
  - Post-GC RSS plateaued at 193–219 MB after warm-up and ended at 193–210 MB.
  - The peak RSS of 309–362 MB appears at the early-snapshot sample. It is the snapshot's own serialization, not workload growth.
- **Scope limit.** `createSessionWorkload()` replaces its `SessionManager` every 128 entries. Its roughly 512-byte messages are also below the 1 KiB resident-blob externalization threshold. This result therefore explains the corpus soak slope, but it does **not** clear retention in a long-lived session or on the blob-externalization path (M01). That needs a fixture with one persistent session and payloads of at least 1 KiB.
- **Slope explanation.** The 28.8 MB/s corpus slope comes from its 1 s soak window. RSS climbs about 70 MB in the first ~500 ms as the allocator reaches its high-water mark, then stops. A longer window drives the slope toward zero. Pre-GC heap churns between about 18 and 32 MB within each 128-entry session, and a GC returns it.
- **CPU.** Inclusive / self shares of profiled time across the three runs. Self time is the time spent in the symbol's own frames.
  - `getEntries`: 46.5–48.9% / 0.0–0.1%; `#getMaterializedEntriesInternal`: 35.9–39.1% / 0.0%
  - `#appendEntry`: 29.2–34.4% / 0.1–1.0%; `#appendEntryWithinPersistenceFence`: 28.3–33.1% / 1.3–2.0%
  - `Object.entries`: 31.5–34.9% / 31.5–34.9%, called from `jsonLikeValueExceedsCacheLimit`'s `visit`, `stripUndefinedPlainObjectFields`, `externalizeResidentValueSync`, `cloneJsonSemantic`, and `materializeResidentValueSync`
  - `Buffer.byteLength`: 9.2–10.9% / 9.2–10.9%
  - `stripUndefinedPlainObjectFields`: 13.0–14.4% / 6.4–8.4%; `externalizeResidentValueSync`: 10.7–15.0% / 4.8–8.3%

Reclassification of the agent-session hotspots from that evidence:

- `CPU-self-time confirmed` requires the hotspot's owning symbols to carry at least 5% of profiled time as **self** time.
- Inclusive-only cost, which sits in callees, is `covered-current`.

| Hotspot | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| M01 `#appendEntry` retention | `covered-current` | 1.3–2.8% self / 29.2–34.4% inclusive; retention not exercised (see scope limit) |
| M02 `getEntries()` copy | `covered-current` | 0.0–0.1% self / 46.5–48.9% inclusive; the cost is the per-entry `Object.entries` walk in callees |
| M03 `buildDisplaySessionContext` | `needs-trace-coverage` | symbol absent from this fixture's profile |
| M04 `AppendOnlyLog` + `cloneJson` | `needs-trace-coverage` | symbol absent from this fixture's profile |
| M05 `captureState`/`restoreState` | `needs-trace-coverage` | symbol absent from this fixture's profile |
| H10 replay equality | `needs-trace-coverage` | symbol absent from this fixture's profile |

No agent-session hotspot is `CPU-self-time confirmed`. The self time sits in shared JSON-shape walkers: `Object.entries`, `Buffer.byteLength`, `stripUndefinedPlainObjectFields`, and `externalizeResidentValueSync`. None of these is a hotspot in the static map. Any optimization there needs a same-host before/after run of this tool, and byte-parity gates still apply.

## Threshold-promotion process

Wall-clock and RSS thresholds are noisy. Promotion is gradual:

1. **Advisory** — reported in the corpus JSON / console; never fails CI. All thresholds start here (`APPLIED_PERF_THRESHOLDS`, `advisoryOrEnforced: "advisory"`, `varianceCharacterized: false`).
2. **Opt-in numeric** — exercised under `PI_TUI_PERF_GATES=1` (see `packages/tui/test/perf-gates.test.ts`).
3. **Enforced** — a hard CI gate, allowed only with `varianceCharacterized: true`, passed before/after `benchmarkEvidence`, and human approval. `validatePerfThresholdLedger()` rejects enforced thresholds lacking this evidence.

Held thresholds (`HELD_PERF_THRESHOLDS`) name candidates that need variance characterization before enforcement.

### Per-release RSS checkpoints

The `rss_checkpoint` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs for every stable tag and nightly. It measures the exact released `gjc-linux-x64` binary and the previous published stable release on the same runner with `scripts/verify-rss-checkpoints.ts --all`, then writes one checkpoint per commit (`<commit>.json` plus `.md`), so a regression can be bisected release to release. The `rss-checkpoint-<version>` run artifact holds both checkpoints. The current binary's compare uses `--compare --advisory --allow-baseline-drift`: this is stage 1 of the process above. Regressions go to the job summary and never fail the release.

To reproduce or bisect locally, point the harness at any compiled binary and give the commit it was built from:

```sh
bun scripts/verify-rss-checkpoints.ts --scenario S1,S5 --write-baseline \
  --binary ./gjc-linux-x64 --commit <full-sha> --output-dir /tmp/rss
```

## Memory baseline protocol

Detailed memory fixtures cover seven explicit surfaces: CLI startup/configuration, AgentSession-style message/context lifecycle, blob/external buffers, worker generations, Telegram reconnect/queue settlement, TUI render/dispose churn, and shared/native transfer boundaries. The fixtures are synthetic lifecycle proxies: they establish a reproducible allocation and teardown envelope but do not by themselves prove a production leak. A production optimization claim still requires a workload adapter that exercises the implicated owner and a same-host before/after artifact.
The command-line runner executes each memory surface in a fresh Bun subprocess and records `runner.memoryIsolation: "process-per-surface"` so allocator high-water state from one fixture cannot contaminate the next surface's baseline. Programmatic `runPerfCorpusBenchmark()` defaults to in-process fixtures and records `"in-process"` for focused contract tests; pass `{ isolatedMemory: true }` for acceptance-equivalent evidence. Process-tree RSS snapshots exclude the `ps` sampler process and degrade both endpoints to `"unavailable"` when either snapshot fails. The process-tree baseline is captured after GC, followed by another GC that clears sampler allocations before the local baseline and workload begin. Soak workloads use single-iteration batches so approximately 50 ms sampling cannot be hidden behind a large synchronous chunk. Post-teardown return fields remain `null` when GC is unavailable.

Use the `short` profile for deterministic contract and shape checks; its bounded iteration window intentionally reports `null` slopes when less than 250 ms is observed. Use `soak` for repeated sampling and slope characterization. For decision evidence:
The soak default runs each surface for at least one second and samples at approximately 50 ms intervals. `GJC_MEMORY_DURATION_MS` accepts 250–60000 ms and `GJC_MEMORY_ITERATIONS` accepts 1–10000000; record overrides with the artifact.

1. Pin the source SHA, Bun version, platform/architecture, profile, fixture inputs, and command.
2. Run at least five short repetitions and three independent soak repetitions on an otherwise idle runner.
3. Exclude warm-up from slope decisions and report the raw samples, median, p95, variance/confidence interval, peak, and post-teardown values. The runner discards the first quarter of the observed window, capped at 250 ms, before calculating a slope and requires at least 250 ms of steady-state samples.
4. Interpret heap, external/array-buffer, RSS, and process-tree evidence separately. A high post-GC RSS with a returned heap may be allocator high-water residency, not a reachability leak.
5. Do not enforce a numeric threshold until variance is characterized and recorded in the threshold ledger. A claimed optimization needs either a statistically supported improvement on the same workload or removal of a reproducible unbounded slope.
6. Treat active handles and post-teardown residue as lifecycle signals, not byte-parity proof. Behavior, transcript/blob integrity, throughput, and latency remain independent gates.

The default fixtures contain no user or provider data. Raw private transcripts remain prohibited.

## Memory retention & fail-closed materialization

Resident-memory retention (hotspots M01–M05) was bounded in Optimization Suite v3 (#548): `EphemeralBlobStore` externalizes large resident text to a session-scoped disk cache with an 8 MiB LRU buffer budget, `getEntries()`/`buildSessionContext()` are served from revision-keyed WeakRef caches and return caller-owned clones, and `captureState`/`restoreState` bump revision domains. Materialization is split by byte sensitivity:

- **Resident byte-sensitive TEXT** (`resolveTextBlobSync`) is **fail-closed**: a missing resident blob throws `ResidentBlobMissingError` rather than degrading, so a missing blob can never silently leak a `blob:sha256:` reference into provider payloads, UI, or exports.
- **Persisted images** (`resolveImageData`/`resolveImageDataUrl` and sync variants) are the **legacy persisted-image compatibility boundary**: a missing blob warns and returns the reference as-is so legacy-session resume degrades gracefully. New byte-sensitive resident data must NOT use this warn-and-return path.

This contract is locked by `packages/coding-agent/test/resident-materialization.test.ts`. Retained growth and post-GC return are measured by `packages/coding-agent/bench/session-memory.bench.ts` (emits the corpus `rssMemory` shape).

**Measured deferral:** further memory rewrites beyond these byte-parity-preserving bounds are deferred to corpus prioritization. Per [`native-ffi-optimization-policy.md`](./native-ffi-optimization-policy.md) and the byte-parity principle, speculative memory rewrites wait for profiler/RSS corpus evidence rather than being undertaken on a static-ranking guess.
